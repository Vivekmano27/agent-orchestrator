# State Machine Designer Skill

## Output Format

Write the state machine spec to `.claude/specs/[feature]/state-machine.md` using this exact structure:

```markdown
# State Machine: [Entity Name]

## States

| State | Description | Entry Action | Terminal? |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| draft | Created but not submitted | — | No |
| pending_review | Submitted, awaiting reviewer | Notify reviewer via email | No |
| approved | Reviewer accepted | Send approval email, create audit log | No |
| rejected | Reviewer declined | Send rejection email with reason | No |
| completed | All post-approval work finished | Update metrics, archive | Yes |
| cancelled | User cancelled before completion | Release held resources | Yes |

## Transitions

| # | From | To | Trigger | Guard | Side Effects |
|---|------|----|---------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | draft | pending_review | user.submit() | All required fields non-empty | Create audit log entry |
| 2 | pending_review | approved | reviewer.approve() | Reviewer role = ADMIN or MANAGER | Send email, log |
| 3 | pending_review | rejected | reviewer.reject(reason) | reason.length > 0 | Send email with reason |
| 4 | rejected | draft | user.revise() | — | Clear previous rejection |
| 5 | approved | completed | system.markDone() | All child tasks resolved | Archive, update dashboard |
| 6 | draft | cancelled | user.cancel() | — | — |
| 7 | pending_review | cancelled | user.cancel() | — | Notify reviewer of cancellation |

```

## TypeScript Implementation Pattern

Generate the implementation alongside the spec. Use a discriminated union + transition map — not a switch statement chain.

```typescript
// src/state-machines/order-state.ts

// 1. Define states as a const enum for zero-cost at runtime
export const OrderState = {
  DRAFT: 'draft',
  PENDING_REVIEW: 'pending_review',
  APPROVED: 'approved',
  REJECTED: 'rejected',
  COMPLETED: 'completed',
  CANCELLED: 'cancelled',
} as const;

export type OrderStateValue = typeof OrderState[keyof typeof OrderState];

// 2. Define events as discriminated union
export type OrderEvent =
  | { type: 'SUBMIT' }
  | { type: 'APPROVE'; reviewerId: string }
  | { type: 'REJECT'; reviewerId: string; reason: string }
  | { type: 'REVISE' }
  | { type: 'MARK_DONE' }
  | { type: 'CANCEL' };

// 3. Guard functions — return string (error message) on failure, null on success
type Guard = (context: OrderContext, event: OrderEvent) => string | null;

const guards: Record<string, Guard> = {
  allFieldsFilled: (ctx) =>
    !ctx.title || !ctx.description ? 'Title and description are required' : null,
  hasReviewerPermission: (ctx, event) => {
    if (event.type !== 'APPROVE' && event.type !== 'REJECT') return 'Invalid event';
    return ctx.reviewerRole === 'ADMIN' || ctx.reviewerRole === 'MANAGER'
      ? null
      : 'Reviewer must be ADMIN or MANAGER';
  },
  rejectionHasReason: (_ctx, event) =>
    event.type === 'REJECT' && event.reason.length === 0
      ? 'Rejection reason is required'
      : null,
  allTasksResolved: (ctx) =>
    ctx.pendingTasks > 0 ? `${ctx.pendingTasks} tasks still pending` : null,
};

// 4. Transition map — single source of truth
interface Transition {
  target: OrderStateValue;
  guard?: Guard;
  sideEffects?: Array<(ctx: OrderContext, event: OrderEvent) => Promise<void>>;
}

const transitions: Record<OrderStateValue, Partial<Record<OrderEvent['type'], Transition>>> = {
  [OrderState.DRAFT]: {
    SUBMIT: {
      target: OrderState.PENDING_REVIEW,
      guard: guards.allFieldsFilled,
      sideEffects: [notifyReviewer, createAuditLog],
    },
    CANCEL: {
      target: OrderState.CANCELLED,
    },
  },
  [OrderState.PENDING_REVIEW]: {
    APPROVE: {
      target: OrderState.APPROVED,
      guard: guards.hasReviewerPermission,
      sideEffects: [sendApprovalEmail, createAuditLog],
    },
    REJECT: {
      target: OrderState.REJECTED,
      guard: guards.rejectionHasReason,
      sideEffects: [sendRejectionEmail, createAuditLog],
    },
    CANCEL: {
      target: OrderState.CANCELLED,
      sideEffects: [notifyReviewerOfCancellation],
    },
  },
  [OrderState.APPROVED]: {
    MARK_DONE: {
      target: OrderState.COMPLETED,
      guard: guards.allTasksResolved,
      sideEffects: [archiveOrder, updateDashboard],
    },
  },
  [OrderState.REJECTED]: {
    REVISE: {
      target: OrderState.DRAFT,
      sideEffects: [clearRejection],
    },
  },
  // Terminal states — no transitions out
  [OrderState.COMPLETED]: {},
  [OrderState.CANCELLED]: {},
};

// 5. Transition executor
export async function transition(
  currentState: OrderStateValue,
  event: OrderEvent,
  context: OrderContext,
): Promise<{ newState: OrderStateValue; error?: string }> {
  const stateTransitions = transitions[currentState];
  const t = stateTransitions?.[event.type];

  if (!t) {
    return {
      newState: currentState,
      error: `No transition from "${currentState}" on event "${event.type}"`,
    };
  }

  if (t.guard) {
    const guardError = t.guard(context, event);
    if (guardError) {
      return { newState: currentState, error: guardError };
    }
  }

  // Execute side effects sequentially (order matters)
  if (t.sideEffects) {
    for (const effect of t.sideEffects) {
      await effect(context, event);
    }
  }

  return { newState: t.target };
}
```

## Validation Checklist

Run these checks against every state machine before finalizing. All must pass.

| # | Check | How to Verify |
|---|-------|---------------|
| 1 | No orphan states | Every state appears as a `From` or `To` in at least one transition (except the initial state which may only appear as `To`) |
| 2 | All transitions have source + target | No transition row has an empty `From` or `To` cell |
| 3 | At least one terminal state | At least one state has `Terminal? = Yes` (no outgoing transitions) |
| 4 | Reachability | Every non-initial state is reachable from the initial state via some sequence of transitions |
| 5 | No dead ends (unless terminal) | Every non-terminal state has at least one outgoing transition |
| 6 | Guards are testable | Every guard condition can be evaluated with data available in the context object — no external API calls in guards |
| 7 | Side effects are idempotent | If a side effect fails and the transition is retried, running the side effect again must not cause duplicates (e.g., use idempotency keys for emails) |
| 8 | Mermaid matches table | The Mermaid diagram has exactly the same states and transitions as the table — no extras, no missing |

## Constraints

1. **Terminal states must have empty transition rows.** If a state has `Terminal? = Yes` but also has outgoing transitions in the table, that is a spec error. Flag it.
2. **Never use string literals for states in implementation code.** Always use the const object (`OrderState.DRAFT`) so typos are caught at compile time.
3. **Guards must be pure functions.** They take context + event and return a result. No database calls, no API calls, no side effects inside guards. If you need to check external state, load it into the context before calling `transition()`.
4. **Side effects execute after guard passes but before the state is persisted.** If a side effect fails, the transition should roll back (state stays the same). Document this in the spec.
5. **Always generate the Mermaid diagram.** Developers will paste it into GitHub PRs for visual review. A state machine without a diagram is incomplete.
